# Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used in server-to-server authentication. Since
this flow does not include authorization, only endpoints that do not access
user information can be accessed.

The following diagram shows how the _Client Credentials Flow_ works:

![Client Credentials Flow](https://developer-assets.spotifycdn.com/images/documentation/web-api/auth-client-credentials.png)

#### Pre-requisites

This guide assumes that:

- You have read the [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization).
- You have created an app following the [app guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps).

#### Source Code

You can find an example app implementing Client Credentials flow on GitHub in
the [web-api-examples](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-examples/tree/master/authorization/client_credentials) repository.

## Request authorization

The first step is to send a `POST` request to the `/api/token` endpoint of the
_Spotify OAuth 2.0 Service_ with the following parameters encoded in
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:

| Body Parameters | Relevance | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| grant\_type | _Required_ | Set it to `client_credentials`. |

The headers of the request must contain the following parameters:

| Header Parameter | Relevance | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization | _Required_ | Base 64 encoded string that contains the client ID and client secret key. The field must have the format: `Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>` |
| Content-Type | _Required_ | Set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. |

The following JavaScript creates and sends an authorization request:

`
var client_id = 'CLIENT_ID';
var client_secret = 'CLIENT_SECRET';
var authOptions = {
url: 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + (new Buffer.from(client_id + ':' + client_secret).toString('base64'))
},
form: {
    grant_type: 'client_credentials'
},
json: true
};
request.post(authOptions, function(error, response, body) {
if (!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
    var token = body.access_token;
}
});
`

### Response

If everything goes well, you'll receive a response with a `200 OK` status and
the following JSON data in the response body:

| key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| access\_token | string | An access token that can be provided in subsequent calls, for example to Spotify Web API services. |
| token\_type | string | How the access token may be used: always "Bearer". |
| expires\_in | int | The time period (in seconds) for which the access token is valid. |

For example:

`
{
"access_token": "NgCXRKc...MzYjw",
"token_type": "bearer",
"expires_in": 3600
}
`
